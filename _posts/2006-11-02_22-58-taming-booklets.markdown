I love hacks to do with actual physical reality.

Today, waiting for a bus, reading a bunch of papers stapled together in one corner (would that be a booklet?), I was annoyed by the fact that the wind would constantly turn the pages when I didn't want them turned.

I didn't have a hand to spare (no gloves), and so I came up with a quick and lovely hack: simply keep the papers together with a pen, using the clip. Worked a charm!
