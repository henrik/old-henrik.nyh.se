Minor updates to iCalTV.

<a href="http://henrik.nyh.se/uploads/iCalTV.zip">Download version 0.6 (244 KB).</a>

The download URLs have changed, so this is a necessary update. Just replace the old <code>iCalTV.app</code> with this one.

I also took the opportunity to fix a small bug. Previous versions stored some temporary data in <code>/tmp</code> which caused conflicts if there were multiple iCalTV users on the same computer.

  <h5>Update 2007-01-04</h5>
  <p>Had left a debug line in 0.6 that caused the scheduled clean-up to produce output, which in turn causes a mail to be sent to the user in the terminal. Now fixed.</p>
