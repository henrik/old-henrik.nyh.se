title: Twitter status update keyword shortcut for Firefox
tags: 
- Firefox
---
I decided to try <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/malesca">me</a>) as a kind of terse personal blog and a way of tracking what I've been doing when. I doubt I'll use it for very long, but while I am testing it, I want a Firefox keyword shortcut for posting.

I'd like to call it a bookmarklet, but it doesn't involve any Javascript, so I suppose it's more properly a Firefox quick search or keyword shortcut.

Anyway, just bookmark <a href="http://twitter.com/status/update?status=%s">http://twitter.com/status/update?status=%s</a> with some Firefox keyword such as "tw", to be able to post updates with "tw Posting an update."
