I think it's fairly common in Rails to define a <code>render_404</code> method and do

{% highlight ruby %}
render_404 and return
{% endhighlight %}
from actions when you want to show a 404 error page (as described <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2006/08/30/being-a-good-little-404er/">here</a>).

A better solution is to <i>raise</i> a custom <code>Error404</code> exception, then catching that in your <code>ApplicationController</code> and rendering the 404 page.

Not a huge difference, but this means you don't have to mess with the <code>and return</code>. It also makes it much easier to divide code across methods and classes, since only the current action can <code>return</code> from itself, but any code it calls can raise exceptions that bubble up to the <code>ApplicationController</code>.

I just put

{% highlight ruby %}
class Error404 < StandardError; end
{% endhighlight %}
at the top of my <code>app/controllers/application.rb</code> and add

{% highlight ruby %}
rescue_from Error404, :with => :render_404
{% endhighlight %}
to the <code>ApplicationController</code>.

The <code>render_404</code> method is described in <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2006/08/30/being-a-good-little-404er/">the article I mentioned</a>.
