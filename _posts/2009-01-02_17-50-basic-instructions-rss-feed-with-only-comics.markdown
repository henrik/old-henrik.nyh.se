One of the many uses of <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/">Yahoo Pipes</a> is to filter a RSS feed.

I just used Pipes to create a version of the <a href="http://basicinstructions.net/">Basic Instructions</a> feed containing only the comics, no other posts.

<a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.run?_id=DHRJZOzY3RGdiMPUrLQIDg&_render=rss">RSS feed with only comics</a>.

<a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=DHRJZOzY3RGdiMPUrLQIDg">Pipe details</a> if you want to view or clone it.
